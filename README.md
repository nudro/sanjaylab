## About the Lab

Here at <a href="https://informationsystems.umbc.edu/"> the University of Maryland Baltimore Count (UMBC) Dept. of Information Systems (IS) </a>, our lab conducts deep learning research developing novel methods towards tasks in multivariate time series imputation for healthcare data, benchmarking and interpretability, survival modeling, competing risk analysis, domain adaptation, and multispectral image translation. We invite you to learn more about our team, current research, and published papers. The lab is always seeking motivated and experienced graduate students for exciting research opportunities, so stay tuned for announcements!

Led by Dr. Purushotham, we are currently working on deep learning applied to risk modeling, content retrieval, multispectral imaging, generative modeling, and natural language processing. Our work has been published at AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), several KDD workshops to include EpiDAMIK and DeepSpatial, IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, and medical journals to include the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Journal of Urology.

We invite you to learn more about the field of **Information Science**, an exciting and interdisciplinary field at UMBC, consisting of research in AI, data science, cybersecurity, and human centered computing. In this ecosystem, our lab is able to draw from a variety of academic experts in the department with experience in fields to include causality, fair learning, and computer vision, where we continue to integrate novel methods into our lab's research.
